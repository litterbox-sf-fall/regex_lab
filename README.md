Regular Expression Exercises
============================

_What are Regular Expressions and what can they do for you?_

Well, they are good for searching for patterns in strings.

Let's say you have a list of files:

```
one.js
one.json
one.html
one.html.erb
two.js
two.json
two.html
two.html.erb
other.js
```

You can use regular expressions to find all the files that match
certain patterns. Maybe you want to operate on all the JavaScript
files, or all the HTML files, or all the filenames with "two" in their
name.

Steps
-----

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to download our dependencies.
3. Look at regex.js (this is the file you'll edit).
4. Look at tests.js (this we've written for you).
5. Run `npm test` to see all the tests fail.
6. Fix the code in tests.js to make the tests pass.

You may need to do some research on Regular Expressions if you can't
figure something out.
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
is never a bad place to look. There are also sites that let you test
out your Regular Expressions in the browser.
